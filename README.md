Good morning, respected jurors!  It is a real pleasure to be here today to present to you our project "Robotin", which has been developed with dedication and effort using Lego EV3 materials and programming through Lego Classroom.
 The creation process of Robotin has been the result of hard team work, where we have incorporated a wide variety of sensors in the design of this robot, including the color sensor.  In addition, Robotin has two motors, each with specific and well-defined functions.
 One of the motors is responsible for propelling the front of the robot forward by detecting the colors red or green.  If it identifies the color red, Robotin autonomously moves back about 6 centimeters and performs a specific sequence of movements: first a rotation to the right for 0.5 seconds followed by a rapid rotation to the left for 0.05 seconds, to then continue your advance.
 On the other hand, if the detected color is green, Robotin moves back the same distance of 6 cm, but the rotation sequence is different: first a rotation to the left of 0.05 seconds and then a rotation to the right of 1.5 seconds. seconds, and then advance again after 1 second.
 Initially, we were working on a prototype using Arduino, but we ran into technical challenges that led us to transition to Lego EV3.  Despite our lack of experience with the Lego EV3 components, we were able to overcome the initial complications with resilience and determination.
 Along this path, we have encountered obstacles, but we remain committed to overcoming them in our quest for success in this project.  We thank you for your attention and support in this presentation!
